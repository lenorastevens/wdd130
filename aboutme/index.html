  <h2>Lenora Stevens</h2>
  <h3>Nick Name:Tris (gaming alias)</h3>
  <p>I live in Texas and I have been married for 27 years. We have 4 sons.  Our sons range in ages from 12 (almost 13) to 22.  Our oldest son is married and is attending BYU Provo with his wife. Our 2nd son is currently a service missionary and our younger 2 sons are in 11th and 7th grades.</p>
  <p>Our family loves to travel.  Our favorite places to visit are the national parks.  We love to hike and spend time exploring this beautiful earth that God has given us.</p>
  <p>I am aiming for a BS in Applied Technologies and am hoping to start a career as a programmer or web designer.  I have a very rational mind and math has always been a strength.  I also love photography so there is a streak of creative in me. I would love to be able to make a website to display my landscape photographs.</p>
  <p>I have been a member of the church my whole life.  I have lots of quotes, talks, and scriptures that mean a lot to me, but there is one that sticks with me every day.  President Monson said "Don't give up what you want most for what you want at the moment."  This reminds me to always stay focused on and work hard to achieve my goals that I set.</p>
  <p>I look forward to getting to know all of you and learning all the things this class has to teach me!</p>
