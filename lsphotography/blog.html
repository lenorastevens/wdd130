                <h3>Jasper National Park</h3>
                <p>We started out the day yesterday with a bear sighting!!! Super fun. Then we managed to visit two more falls and the Edith Cavell glacier today in the Jasper area. It's amazing to me to see so much water flowing everywhere! It's beautiful, yet contains so much power to affect things in it's path. We had a yummy dinner, ice cream, card games, an evening hike around the campground.
                    We toured one last falls before packing up and leaving Jasper today. Maligne Canyon did not disappoint! Everyone agreed it was a crowning sight to end our national parks tour with. We all loved the canyon and the natural rock heart stuck in the crevice was nature's version of an exclaimation point! Plus, I was able to spend a few minutes last night getting some long exposure shots. The skies were Beautiful! I love this beautiful earth God has given us!</p>

                <h3>Icefields Parkway</h3>
                <p>Monday we started our drive up the Icefields Parkway. This road is amazing!!! Our plan was to head to the Columbian Icefields, but saw too many beautiful things to stop and see. Eventually we set up camp at Waterfowl Lakes campground, filled up the paddle boards, put them in up river, then rode them down into the lake. It was a blast!!! Perfect weather, beautiful lake, fun group of people!!!! Ended the day with a sunset walk with the hubby. 
                    Tuesday we finished driving the Icefields Parkway and made it to our campground in Jasper. We stopped at places like Peyto Lake (glacier and lake together  ), Nystaya Falls, Columbian Icefields Skywalk, and Upper Waterfowl Lake. In this part of the world, lakes, falls, rivers, mountains, glaciers, and woods are plentiful. Our kids are beginning to be overloaded, but I could never get enough.</p>

                <h3>Kooteney National Park</h3>
                <p>Sunday we switched campsites and national parks. We spent the day exploring Kootney National Park. Starting with Marble Canyon (thin canyon carved by the rushing water), then Paint Pots (natural vibrant orange clay soil), then Numa Falls and then we wound down the day in the hot springs.  This area of the rockies has a lot of springs, and they built a public pool around one.  The warmth was very enjoyable. Earlier in the day, Ben was able to "enjoy" washing off in the cold river after an unfortunate encounter with a muddy slope. Of course we stood by and supported him by taking video and pictures while cheering him on  Amazing day!! As we headed back into our camp ground we had the treat of encountering a heard of mountain goats just hanging out. They sat patiently as we took plenty of pictures from the car windows.</p>

                <h3>Yoho National Park</h3>
                <p>Saturday we explored Yoho National Park. Beside the fact that it turned out to be the breeding ground for the world's population of mosquitos....we saw some incredible things. We accidently drove down a county dirt road for miles and ended up at a beatiful view of a distant waterfall that was framed by the forrest we were standing in. We then mangaged to find the trailhead and hike to that very fast flowing waterfall (with a rainbow at the edge). Too many mosquitos there so we went to Emerald Lake and played with a paddle board in a cold yet beautiful lake. I loved recording the family's reaction to jumping into the cold water! This is when I prefer to be photographer and stay dry. On our way back to the campground we checked out "natural bridge" where the water flow wore a hole in the rock. Exhausting, but amazing day!!!</p>

                <h3>Banff National Park</h3>
                <p>Yesterday we finished driving to and then spent time exploring Banff by touring Cave and Basin historic site (which is the origin of how the Canadian park system began) and walking the marsh lands around. Ben got to be part of the tour presentation, which was fun. After too much sun and way too many mosquito bites we took shelter in the RV for a few hours. After dinner we hiked Tunnel Mountain Summit trail and accidentally timed it just right to enjoy a sunset! After getting everyone showered and to bed I managed to score a nice shot of the clear night sky!</p>

                <h3>Going to the Sun Road</h3>
                <p>Yesterday we were getting ready to head to Banff when we learned that the Going to the Sun Road finally opened!!! This was the last day of our pass so we headed up the road instead. It was very much worth the delay!!! So beautiful. It took us most of the day to drive the road. We stopped at Logan pass and walked around but the hikes weren't open yet.  We took a break on the west side for lunch and ice cream. We then crossed the boarder (no problems!!), resupplied, and gave up on reaching Banff and just bedded down in Calgary at a Walmart. So much to be grateful for!!!</p>

                <h3>Many Glacier</h3>
                <p>We have not had great coverage or much spare time to get photos posted, but we have been having an amazing time! We spent Tuesday at Many Glacier. We got off a little late and found out the area filled up and was closed. We ate our picnic in the parking lot by the gate and waited until they opened. Tom took a nap in the parking lot on a ground cloth. It was worth the wait we had an enjoyable hike to some falls, had a contest who could keep their feet in the water the longest, walked all my needed steps and enjoyed each other. Didn't quite hike high enough to see snow. Great day!</p>

                <h3>East Glacier</h3>
                <p>Only a small part of East Glacier was accessible today.  The main road is not open yet.  We checked with the Visitors Center to see the movie and get advice from a ranger as to what we should visit. East Glacier Three waterfalls trail from Sun Point was a long, but amazing hike. We included a mandatory break in the RV mid-afternoon to take cover from the intense Sun. A few of us did a sunset hike, pretty! We were a little disappointed that we couldn't access Logan Pass yet and 2 of the amazing hikes up there were also unavailable. However, we explored what we could and enjoyed it.</p>

                <h3>Great Basin National Park</h3>
                <p>We had a great time exploring the upper elevations of Great Basin National Park today. Lots of hiking, bristlecone pine trees (really really old trees), climbing rocks, mountain streams and lakes, even some snow. We really enjoyed it! I forgot my camera in the RV, so here are my phone pics  
                    We started the last day out with a tour of Lehman Caves. Amazing! We have toured a lot of caves and this one ranked pretty high up there. Great tour guide, too. Did a little more hiking and then finally got a chance to try out some night photography. We are heading out of Great Basin tomorrow and on to American Fork to see family and pick up Ben and Lacey.</p>

                <h3>North Rim Grand Cayon</h3>
                <p>We spent all of today exploring the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. I love this side!!! Because of the pines, this side has so much green to contrast the red and browns. Kids and hubby climbed as many rocks and hung over as many ledges as they could. We hiked partially down the trail that goes all the way to the river and up the other side.  There was a good overlook of the green canyon. Unfortunately, this trail is also shared by the mules for tourists who want an easier hike. We enjoyed many overlooks.  There is a lot of driving that can be done, but each overlook is worth it. Luckily no car sick kids! We ended up back at the RV exhausted, but immensely satisfied.</p>

                <h3>Horseshoe Bend</h3>
                <p>After a bit of a drive from Phoenix, the sight seeing began on Sunday with a visit to Glen Canyon Dam (no tours still because of COVID) and closed when we got there. Then hiked out to Horseshoe Bend for a checklist must see. I have driven this road a million times and never seen the bend in the river. Managed to time it right for a sunset! The boys of course had to sit right on the edge with their legs dangling over the edge. I managed to drop piece to my camera lens that shades the lens from light and it rolled down the slope and into the crevice. Yikes! When I saw one of my boys start to chase it I yelled no.  I was terrified they would unnecessarily fall with it!</p>
